All nunu.ai API requests require authentication using an API key. This page covers how to create, manage, and use API keys.

## Creating API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to **Project Admin → API Keys** in the nunu.ai dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Click **Create API Key**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select permissions">
    Choose the permissions your key needs based on your use case
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your key">
    Copy and securely store your key—it won't be shown again
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header with every request:

```http
GET /api/v1/runs HTTP/1.1
Host: nunu.ai
X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://nunu.ai/api/v1/runs" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```typescript JavaScript/TypeScript
const response = await fetch("https://nunu.ai/api/v1/runs", {
  headers: {
    "X-Api-Key": process.env.NUNU_API_TOKEN,
  },
});
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

response = requests.get(
    "https://nunu.ai/api/v1/runs",
    headers={"X-Api-Key": os.environ["NUNU_API_TOKEN"]}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Permissions

API keys are scoped to specific permissions. Request only the permissions your integration needs:

| Permission | Description | Endpoints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project:read-runs` | Read run data, artifacts, and bug reports | `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}`, `GET /runs/{id}/bugs` |
| `project:operate-runs` | Start and stop test runs | `POST /runs`, `POST /runs/stop` |
| `project:manage-build-storage` | Upload, manage, and delete builds | All `/builds/*` endpoints |

### Combining Permissions

A single API key can have multiple permissions. For example, a CI/CD integration might need both `project:manage-build-storage` (to upload builds) and `project:operate-runs` (to trigger tests).

## Key Management Best Practices

### Use Environment Variables

Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:

```bash
# Set in your CI/CD environment or shell profile
export NUNU_API_TOKEN=your_token
export NUNU_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Rotate Keys Regularly

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create new key">
    Create a new API key with the same permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update integrations">
    Update all integrations with the new key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deactivate old key">
    Deactivate the old key after confirming the transition works
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use Separate Keys for Different Purposes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CI/CD Integration">
    Permissions: `project:manage-build-storage` + `project:operate-runs`
    
    Use for uploading builds and triggering tests from your CI/CD pipeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitoring Dashboard">
    Permissions: `project:read-runs` only
    
    Use for read-only access to view test results and run history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build Upload Only">
    Permissions: `project:manage-build-storage` only
    
    Use when you only need to upload builds without triggering tests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Monitor Key Usage

Check the **Last Used** timestamp in Project Admin → API Keys to identify unused keys that should be removed.

## Key Expiration

API keys can be configured with an expiration date. After expiration, requests with that key will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

<Tip>
  To avoid disruption:
  - Set calendar reminders before key expiration
  - Create replacement keys in advance
  - Monitor for `403` errors in your integrations
</Tip>

## Error Responses

### Missing API Key (401)

```json
{
  "error": "API key required"
}
```

**Solution**: Include the `X-Api-Key` header in your request.

### Invalid API Key (401)

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

**Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been deactivated.

### Expired API Key (403)

```json
{
  "error": "API key expired"
}
```

**Solution**: Create a new API key and update your integration.

### Disabled API Key (403)

```json
{
  "error": "API key is disabled"
}
```

**Solution**: Re-enable the key in Project Admin or create a new one.

### Missing Permission (403)

```json
{
  "error": "API key missing required permission: project:operate-runs"
}
```

**Solution**: Edit the API key to add the required permission, or create a new key with the needed permissions.

## Security Recommendations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Server-Side Only" icon="server">
    API keys should only be used in server-side or CI/CD environments
  </Card>
  <Card title="HTTPS Only" icon="lock">
    All API requests must use HTTPS
  </Card>
  <Card title="Least Privilege" icon="shield">
    Grant only the permissions each integration needs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regular Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
    Review and remove unused API keys regularly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  In CI/CD, use your platform's secrets management (GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables, Jenkins Credentials, etc.) to securely store API keys.
