---

The nunu.ai Public API allows you to programmatically interact with your projects, manage test runs, and upload builds. Use it to integrate nunu.ai into your CI/CD pipelines, build custom tooling, or automate your testing workflows.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://nunu.ai/api/v1
```

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Runs" icon="play" href="/api-reference/runs/list-runs">
    Start tests, monitor progress, retrieve results, and access bug reports
  </Card>
  <Card title="Builds" icon="box" href="/api-reference/builds/initiate-upload">
    Upload and manage builds in nunu.ai's cloud storage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Runs Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`/runs`](/api-reference/runs/list-runs) | GET | List runs with filtering and pagination |
| [`/runs`](/api-reference/runs/start-run) | POST | Start a test or test plan |
| [`/runs/{runId}`](/api-reference/runs/get-run) | GET | Get detailed run information with artifacts |
| [`/runs/{runId}/bugs`](/api-reference/runs/list-bugs) | GET | List bugs found in a run |
| [`/runs/stop`](/api-reference/runs/stop-runs) | POST | Stop one or more running tests |

### Builds Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`/builds/upload`](/api-reference/builds/initiate-upload) | POST | Initiate a build upload |
| [`/builds/upload/parts`](/api-reference/builds/get-upload-parts) | GET | Get presigned URLs for multipart upload |
| [`/builds/upload/complete`](/api-reference/builds/complete-upload) | POST | Complete an upload |
| [`/builds/upload`](/api-reference/builds/cancel-upload) | DELETE | Cancel an in-progress upload |

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via an API key. Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header:

```http
X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Get your API keys from **Project Admin → API Keys** in the nunu.ai dashboard. Each key requires specific permissions based on the endpoints you want to access.

## Permissions

API keys are scoped to specific permissions. Use only the permissions you need:

| Permission | Description | Required For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project:read-runs` | Read run data, artifacts, and bugs | Listing runs, getting run details |
| `project:operate-runs` | Start and stop test runs | Starting tests, stopping runs |
| `project:manage-build-storage` | Upload and manage builds | All build upload operations |

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON. Successful responses typically include:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "pagination": { ... }  // For paginated endpoints
}
```

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": { ... }
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created (for POST requests that create resources) |
| `207` | Multi-Status (partial success for batch operations) |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Missing or invalid API key |
| `403` | Forbidden - API key lacks required permission |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `402` | Payment Required - Quota exceeded |
| `413` | Payload Too Large - File exceeds limits |
| `500` | Internal Server Error |

## Rate Limits

The API uses rate limiting to ensure fair usage. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff when retrying requests.

## SDKs and Tools

While you can use the API directly, we recommend using our official tools for common use cases:
